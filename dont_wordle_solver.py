This is a partial greedy solver for the game "Don't Wordle".
Here's the rule description:

HOW TO PLAY
Don't Wordle is just like Wordle but the opposite.

In Wordle, the goal is to guess a particular 5 letter word in 6 or fewer tries. In Don't Wordle, the goal is to NOT guess the word.

The catch is that your word attempts must respect the information you have learned in previous guesses.

ðŸŸ© - Once you place a letter correctly, then future guesses must contain that same letter in the same position
ðŸŸ¨ - Once you place a correct letter in an incorrect location, then future guesses must contain that letter in a different location
â¬œ - Once letters have been guessed and eliminated, then you can no longer use them
The number of valid words remaining appears at the top, and it will shrink with each guess. If the number gets too low, you can use one of your "UNDOs" to reverse course.

Be careful! If you accidentally enter the Wordle word, the game is over even if you have some UNDOs remaining.
"""

"""
IMPORTANT - Algorithm limitations

- It only goes one layer deep (greedy)
- It assumes every letter in a guess is a miss (grey) and ignores the possibility of yellows and greens
    - This is a big limitation but it's still a fun tool
